Author: Chris Brown

Acknowledgment: 
	Code I used was code made by me. I used geeks for geeks and stack overflow for answers
	to questions I had

Getting Started:
	make to compile everything, and your command line to run everything is
	./a.out blazersh.log
	everything words but the signals sometimes work and sometimes do not

	**** you may have to exit the terminal when using ctrl-C, it causes an inifite loop *******
	
	I have 2 .h files that hold the majority of the functions
	other than that the print statements will tell you what is going on, any problems please email me

Running the test:
	I included a file called math. All it does it sleep for whatever int gets sent to it
